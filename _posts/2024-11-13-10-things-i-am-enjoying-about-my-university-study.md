title: 10 things I'm enjoying (so far) about my university study
---

I came back to uni. Was fortunate enough to enrol for free (definitely the best employer perk ever). The course started some time ago, at the start of October. Here's what I like about it all, so far.

**1. The need for constant work.** This means that, although my time is shared between work, chores, rest and hanging out with M., I now also need to find some time to systematically go through my readings and exercises. This is good, as I'm not one for growing such discipline organically.

**2. The need to acknowledge my ignorance.** In your forties, you tend to think you've seen it all already. The module quickly made me park that idea - there are things we'll be expected to do, read, write, make and demonstrate, and they aren't something I can fudge my way through. So it starts with realizing I know less than I thought.

**3. Studying online...** The module is with the Open University. The grand-daddy of distance learning. Still Covid-conscious, and still avoiding crowded spaces, so this type of study works for me.

**4. But with plenty of human contact.** There are forums, shared posting boards, tutorials, and an occasional face-to-face meetup. This is a chance to listen, chat, watch, do something together. Enjoying this mix, because finding other folks who care about the same stuff is precious.

**5. My study is crowding out less healthy habits.** Let's just say I really don't have time to cultivate a robust collection of news articles I've been recently outraged with. It's either my study or the world's news, and I know what I'd rather do.

**6. This is the perfect case study for my work.** As I work for the OU, I'm currently experiencing the other end of courses, modules, resources and experiences which I sometimes help build. It's not a direct correlation - the OU is big enough to still feel anonymous - but I get to see, feel, think the way all our learners do. That is a series of eye-openers in itself, without getting to the subject matter!

**7. The module I'm on is lots of good, serious fun.** "U101: Creativity for the 21st Century" was the best possible choice for me. We talk about design thinking, and we get to make lots of interesting stuff. I take photos, make prototypes, dabble with compositions... It's not all reading and essays, which I'm grateful for.

**8. I'll have the chance to put together my own degree(s).** The module is part of a BA / BSc Open, a pick-and-mix degree from the Open University. Now this... is multipotentialite heaven. Not only am I allowed to change direction every year - I'm practically enocuraged to do so!

**9. This means some top-notch mid-life upskilling.** When I was graduating 18 years ago, I had no idea where I'd be in my 40s. This module, and the ones which will follow, might be the best chance to plug the gaps in my knowledge, and prepare me for what's ahead.

**10. I'm getting inspired to build my own research around the module.** Sure, it's a 101 course, but I'm already seeing some lightbulb moments. And although I've only just started, I realize how much I missed being taught, challenged, inspired. Anything I learn, write, research or make will now have this added depth and direction.

What have you been learning lately?
