title: On humbler beginnings
---

I'm a serial blog starter, and a chronic blog abandoner. ["The history of my stupidity would fill many volumes", says Mi≈Çosz](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49483/account-56d22b9cd1542) - for myself, I'm sure that the history of my blogging attempts would at least be a good blog listicle on its own.

So I've grown weary of first posts, and tonight, while I hope I strike the right tone with this one (something about auspicious beginnings, but without any grand schemes in mind), I also hope for the days that follow to define this blog much more.

Will I post something here every day? That's the ambition. And of course, there is absolutely nothing this first post can do to achieve it. Here's what's certain to happen:

For the next 8 years, if all goes very well, I will be making my way through several part-time university modules and courses. This means I will have plenty of new (to me, and maybe to some of you) skills and explorations to think and write about.

For all this time, if all goes very well, I will also be working with lifelong learning, instructional design, and educational technologies. This will mean that any new project - from accessibility to learning design; from pedagogies to coding - is likely to find its way to my personal notes and blog posts.

And even if it all doesn't go very well - I will still be passing through my months, surrounded by books, people, video games, journeys, photographs, cities, discoveries, music. Each of these will connect to more good stuff. And many of these will be inspiring enough to write at least a few excited lines with a URL at the end, to share with you.

So there we are.
Hello, I'm Vic.
